This error occurs when using the `useRef` hook in React Native with an object as its initial value.  The problem is that whenever the component re-renders, the object referenced by `useRef` is replaced with a new object, even if the object itself hasn't changed. This leads to unexpected behavior and makes it difficult to update the object persistently within the component's lifecycle.
